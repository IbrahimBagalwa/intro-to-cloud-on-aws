# Basic Architecture of a Computer

This document provides an overview of the fundamental components of a computer, which are also the building blocks of cloud computing. Understanding these components is crucial as they define the performance characteristics of your applications in the cloud and impact the cost of running these applications.

The key components of a computer include:

1. **Processor (CPU)**: The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, performs all processing tasks. It's measured in Gigahertz (GHz).

2. **Memory (RAM)**: RAM is a non-persistent type of memory. This means that any data stored in RAM is lost when the computer is shut down. RAM is measured in Gigabytes (GB).

3. **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**: The HDD is a persistent storage device. You can store data on the HDD, turn off your computer, and the data will still be there when you turn the computer back on. The HDD is measured in Gigabytes (GB) or Terabytes (TB).

4. **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: The NIC allows your computer to connect to a network. It's measured in Gigabits per second (Gbps).

When you boot your computer, the operating system files stored on the HDD are loaded into RAM by the CPU. As we move towards cloud computing, you'll notice that for certain services, you can choose the amount of CPU, RAM, persistent storage, and network capacity you need for your application. This is why understanding these components is essential.
