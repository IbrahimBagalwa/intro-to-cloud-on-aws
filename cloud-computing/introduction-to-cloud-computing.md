| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| On-demand, self-service | A user can consume cloud resources, as needed, automatically, any without human interaction                             |
| Broad network access    | Capabilities are available over the network using standard mechanisms. Can be the internet or a Wide Area Network (WAN) |
| Resource pooling        | The providers resources are pooled and serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model                              |
| Rapid elasticity        | Capabilities can scale "elastically" based on demand                                                                    |
| Measured service        | Resource usage is monitored and metered                                                                                 |

Brief: **Cloud Computing** is the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. In simple word _cloud computing_ is a way to use computing services, like storage, databases, and servers, over the internet instead of using local computers or servers.

### Benefits:

- No need to invest in expensive hardware or maintain it.
- You can size your website and database according to what you need.
- Access your data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.

#### Launching cloud services: Management console

- You can use a graphical user interface in a web browser in order to launch services on the cloud.
  So an example of this is the AWS management console.

  From here you can choose a service under a certain category like you can choose EC2 if you want to launch a server in the cloud or S3 if you want to store some data on the cloud.
  You can access this through a standard web browser so you do not need any special software.
- Command line, with the command line you have to install something on your computer , like command line interface from your cloud service provider and then you can run commands from anywhere on the internet and launch cloud services.

- Code (SDK): in this case a developer is going to write some code in what's called an integrated development environment (IDE). You can write some code and then use that to launch services in the cloud.
