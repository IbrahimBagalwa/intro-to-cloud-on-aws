| On-demand, self-service | A user can consume cloud resources, as needed, automatically, any without human interaction                             |
| Broad network access    | Capabilities are available over the network using standard mechanisms. Can be the internet or a Wide Area Network (WAN) |
| Resource pooling        | The providers resources are pooled and serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model                              |
| Rapid elasticity        | Capabilities can scale "elastically" based on demand                                                                    |
| Measured service        | Resource usage is monitored and metered                                                                                 |

Brief: **Cloud Computing** is the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. In simple word _cloud computing_ is a way to use computing services, like storage, databases, and servers, over the internet instead of using local computers or servers.
